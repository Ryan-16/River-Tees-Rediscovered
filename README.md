# Usage
This project is not yet publicly hosted as hosting choices have not yet been made by the client, hence it is not yet available on the web. These instructions will guide you on how to lauch the web-server and database server locally.

## Database Server


## Web Server

Note: This web-server is designed to run on a linux system, so it may not run properlly on a windows machine.

To launch the web-server navigate to the `Main_Proj` directory and (if it is the first launch), type `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
The website is now accesible on `localhost:8080` from your web browser
